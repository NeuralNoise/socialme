Welcome to SocialMe, the free (software) social network*.

SocialMe may be the stupidest idea on Earth: "WTF we need ANOTHER social 
network?" and peanuts thrown at us.

This is maybe your basis for your beloved, no-bloat, personal social 
network. (Although it won't be fun without some friends, though.)

Technology used:
o Facebox (http://github.com/defunkt/facebox)
o YUI Compressor (http://developer.yahoo.com/)
o jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
o web.py (http://webpy.org/)

*That's how GNU geeks say: "the free thingy that does foo and bar"**...
**But not if this is the "Ultimate Destiny of Free Software of Killing 
Non-Free Software"***. Only one WILL WIN! We wonder who will****.

Applications are implemented depending on type:
	* Web (on SocialMe): OpenSocial application
	* Web (non-SocialMe): OAuth HMAC-SHA1
	* Desktop: OAuth HMAC-SHA1

(Looking like MySpace yet?)

But, here's the URLs to keep in mind for OAuth:
	* '/oauth/request_token.php' - request a oauth_request_token
	* '/login.php?type=oauth&token=blahblah' - login user
	* '/oauth/upgrade_token.php' - upgrade request_token to access_token

(One URL is like Facebook)
